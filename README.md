## Other research

- **[Online learning of molecular kinetics](https://github.com/RobertArbon/online_kinetics)** - WIP.  Online (i.e., 1 epoch) learning of the Koopman operator for molecular kinetics using VAMPnets.
- **Markov state model sensitivity and hyperparameter optimisation** - WIP.  Investigating the sensitivity of Markov state models to pipeline hyperparameters and suitability for Bayesian optimisation. 
  - [Paper](https://github.com/RobertArbon/MSM-Hyperparameter-Optimisation)
