- **PhD** - Markov models of Biomolecular systems
  - [Thesis](https://github.com/RobertArbon/Rob-Arbon-Thesis) - my thesis. 
  - [Chapter 3](https://github.com/RobertArbon/alanine_dipeptide) - Using Bayesian optimistaion to optimise MSMs of alanine dipeptide.

## Other research

- **[Online learning of molecular kinetics](https://github.com/RobertArbon/online_kinetics)** - WIP.  Online (i.e., 1 epoch) learning of the Koopman operator for molecular kinetics using VAMPnets.
- **Markov state model sensitivity and hyperparameter optimisation** - WIP.  Investigating the sensitivity of Markov state models to pipeline hyperparameters and suitability for Bayesian optimisation. 
  - [Paper](https://github.com/RobertArbon/MSM-Hyperparameter-Optimisation)
  - [Results analysis](https://github.com/RobertArbon/msm_sensitivity_analysis)
  - [Data generation](https://github.com/RobertArbon/msm_sensitivity)
  - [Deprecated - results analysis](https://github.com/RobertArbon/msm_hyperparameter_optimisation). Old version of results analysis. Has some useful code but is not current.
- **[InvSpec](https://github.com/RobertArbon/invspec)** - A package that generates stochastic matrices with given eignevalue spectrum (InvSpec = Invert Spectrum). 
- **[Adaptive](https://github.com/RobertArbon/adaptive)** - A package the tests coverage times for graph exploration using various adaptive sampling strategies.
- **[Multitask learning for AMR](https://github.com/RobertArbon/multitask_learning_for_AMR)** - Small R-markdown notebooks that test some multitask learning algorithms for veterinary epidemiology.
